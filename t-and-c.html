      <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong>
      <p>
         By downloading or using the app, these terms will
         automatically apply to you — you should make sure therefore
         that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
         allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or
         our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
         extract the source code of the app, and you are also not permitted to
         translate the app into other languages, or make derivative
         versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,
         and other intellectual property rights related
         to it, belong to Tim Morgan.
      </p>
      <p>
         Tim Morgan is committed to ensuring that the app is
         as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
         reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
         its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
         charge you for the app or its services without making it
         clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
      </p>
      <!---->
      <p>
         You should be aware that there are certain things that
         Tim Morgan will not take responsibility for. Certain
         functions of the app will require the app to have an active
         Internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
         by your mobile network provider, but Tim Morgan
         cannot take responsibility for the app not working at its full
         functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, or you don’t
         have any of your data allowance left.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
         If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
         should remember that the terms of your agreement with your
         mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
         be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
         the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
         other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
         responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
         charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
         (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
         you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
         using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
         received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
      </p>
      <p>
         Along the same lines, Tim Morgan cannot always take
         responsibility for the way you use the app; for example, you need to
         make sure that your device stays charged. If it runs out of
         battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
         Tim Morgan cannot accept responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
         At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
         currently available on iOS — the hardware requirements may change,
         and you may need to download the updates if you want to keep
         using the app. Tim Morgan does not promise that he
         will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
         and/or works with the iOS version that you have
         installed on your device. We may
         also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
         it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
         Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
         rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
         (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
         from your device.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
      <p>
         I may update the Terms and Conditions
         from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
         periodically for any changes.
      </p>
      <p>
         These terms and conditions are effective as of February 8, 2021.
